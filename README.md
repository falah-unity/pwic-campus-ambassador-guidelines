# Definition of the Campus Program

The PWiC Campus Program is designed to increase participation, recruit future team members and expand our network and visibility. PWiC Campus Representatives are individuals who propagate the PWiC core values of learning, connecting and growing within their own community. 

In previous years, this program was called the Student Ambassador program. This year, it has been expanded to include a Campus Lead position as well. 

The PWiC Campus Lead Program is designed to train ambassadors who are interested in leadership. Campus Leads will be selected from the current Campus Ambassador cohort and will have an additional focus on developing their leadership and other soft skills throughout the year. 

As a Campus Ambassador or Lead, you will use your passion for technology and your drive to create an impact. PWiC is a young but rapidly-growing organization and you can play a crucial role in shaping its future. 


# PWiC Campus Representative Guidelines

## Why do we need these guidelines?

Here are some of the reasons we need this handbook:

2. We take help from existing communities and material wherever we can (without reinventing the wheel every time) - for operations, organization etc
3. We are aligned in the overall direction and vision when it comes to appointing our campus ambassadors or campus leads - with small deviances in how we operate locally given the social dynamics of the locality
