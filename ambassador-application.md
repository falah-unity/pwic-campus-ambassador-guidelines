# Applying to become a Student Ambassador

In order to be considered for the role of a student ambassador you must fill out the application form available here: https://forms.gle/SVGzZRv6cbySWxTz7. There are two rounds. Round 1 will close 20th June 2021 11:59 PM Pakistan Standard Time. Shortlisted round 1 applicants will be contacted 2 weeks after the deadline. Round 2 will begin on 21st June 2021 and end on 22nd August 2021. Applications will instead be considered on a rolling basis and shortlisted applicants will be contacted approximately 2 weeks after application submission. 

Shortlisted applicants will be selected through a review process by the program leads. Shortlisted applicants will be asked to select a slot for an interview when contacted. 

As this is an organization representing women and underrepresented groups, we strongly prefer to have a representative from such a community in this position (unless there is a valid exception), hence we are only accepting Women with Pakistani background for this role.

There are no fees or costs associated with the process of applying or becoming an ambassador. This is a volunteer-based role.
