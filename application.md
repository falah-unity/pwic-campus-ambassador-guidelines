# Applying to become a Campus Ambassador or Campus Lead

In order to be considered for the role of a Campus Ambassador or Campus Lead, you must fill out the application form available here: [Application](https://forms.gle/oSggpfovJJGHy6wG7). There are two rounds. Round 1 will close 3rd July 2022 11:59 PM Pakistan Standard Time. Shortlisted round 1 applicants will be contacted 2 weeks after the deadline. Round 2 will begin on 4th July 2022 and end on 14th August 2022. Applications will instead be considered on a rolling basis and shortlisted applicants will be contacted approximately 2 weeks after application submission. 

Shortlisted applicants will be selected through a review process by the program leads. Shortlisted applicants will be asked to select a slot for an interview when contacted. 

Due to the nature of the Campus Lead program, spots are limited and individuals who apply for it may be given only a Campus Ambassador position after the application process as well.
If you applied for just an Ambassador Position, you will be notified of either an Ambassador appointment or a program rejection at the end. If you applied for a Lead position as well, you will be notified of either a Lead position, an Ambassador position or a program rejection at the end. You will have 1 week to accept or decline the given position.

As this is an organization representing women and underrepresented groups, we strongly prefer to have a representative from such a community in this position (unless there is a really valid exception), hence we are only accepting Women or other gender minorities with a Pakistani background for this role. 

There are no fees or costs associated with the process of applying or becoming a campus ambassador. This is a volunteer-based role. 

A Campus Ambassador or Lead’s term will last one academic year. A discussion about renewing their role or taking another role in PWiC will take place at the end of their appointment.
