# Applying to become a Student Ambassador

In order to be considered for the role of a student ambassador you must fill out the application form available here: https://forms.gle/eodC8oSq5uZtaYYi6

The form will be reviewed by the ambassador program leads who will determine whether you will move to the next step of the process. If you are moved to the next step, you will then be contacted for an interview within two weeks of submitting your application. You will be informed of whether you were selected or not within a week of the interview.

As this is an organization representing women and underrepresented groups, we strongly prefer to have a representative from such a community in this position (unless there is a valid exception), hence we are only accepting Women with Pakistani background for this role.

There are no fees or costs associated with the process of applying or becoming an ambassador. This is a volunteer-based role.

As a PWiC Student Ambassador, you will help PWiC expand by creating a community at your university or college. A student ambassador’s term will last one academic year. A discussion about renewing their role or taking another role in PWiC will take place at the end of their appointment.
